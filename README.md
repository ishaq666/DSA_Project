# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game  

A simple yet engaging **Tic Tac Toe game** implemented in **Python**.  
This project demonstrates the use of **basic data structures, control flow, and GUI programming** with Tkinter.  

The game is available in two modes:  
- 🖥 **Console Version** (play in terminal)  
- 🪟 **GUI Version** (interactive Tkinter window)

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### ✅ Prerequisites  
- Python **3.x**  
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)  

---

### 🔧 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToe.git
   cd TicTacToe
2. python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
  venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

3. No extra libraries are required. You're good to go! 🎉

### ▶️ Running the Game

  1️⃣ Console Version
   - cd console
   - python tic_tac_toe_console.py
  
  2️⃣ GUI Version
   - cd gui
   - python tic_tac_toe_gui.py

### 🛠 Data Structures & DSA Concepts Used
       
  * This project incorporates several core DSA concepts:
  
  # 2D Arrays (Lists of Lists)
  - Used to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.
  - Enables easy access and update of board cells.
  # Loops
  - Iterating through rows and columns to check win conditions.
  # Conditionals (if-else)
  - Determine valid moves, wins, draws, and invalid inputs.
  # Functions / Methods
  - Encapsulate logic for board display, move validation, and win     checking.
  # Event-Driven Programming (GUI version)
  - Handling button clicks and updating the board dynamically.
  # Game Logic / Algorithm Design
  - Check for row, column, and diagonal matches.
  - Determine end-game scenarios efficiently.
